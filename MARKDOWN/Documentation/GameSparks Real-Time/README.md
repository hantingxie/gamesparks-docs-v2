# GameSparks Real-Time Services

Our real-time services provide a network communication layer with the capability to send and receive data in real-time:

* **Designed for Multiplayer Contexts.** Carefully designed to support multiplayer networked games where player and game-data should be sent and received as quickly as possible.

* **Host Server Support for Player vs. Player (PvP) Model.** We use a PvP model for our network programming. However, we use a host server to relay communications between players and deliver important benefits:
  * Supports a higher number of players than traditional PvP models.
  * Gives you the option to host games in the regions of your choice to reduce latency issues.

* **Lightweight and Flexible SDK.** A very lightweight SDK gives you, the developer, tight control over what is sent and received:
  * Wide flexibility on what data you send and how you wish to send the data.
  * Data packets an be kept as small as possible making transmission much more efficient.

* **GameSparks Real-Time Server** Designed specifically for real-time games:
  * Low latency socket server supporting high throughput and low transmission sizes.
