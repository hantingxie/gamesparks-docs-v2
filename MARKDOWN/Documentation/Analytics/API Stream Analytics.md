# API Stream Analytics

You can use the *API Stream* Analytics page to build custom queries against the (current session) of API calls into the platform:
* A *Query Builder* gives you virtually limitless scope to quickly add and refine query rules to obtain the specific data you want to review and analyse.
* The data returned for your query is then displayed in three chart formats: a histogram, pie-chart, and data table, where each format gives you further tools for analysing the data.
* You can use settings to control how your query data is organised within these charts.
.
In this topic, we'll work through some worked examples of building API Stream queries and reviewing and analysing the data returned

## Any Constraints?

* Range and scope of data?
* Clarify just what data can be queried - is it only requests calls?

## Example 1 - Connection Requests Analytics

In this example, we pull API Stream analytics for connection requests calls into the platform:

*1.* Open the *Analytics > API Stream* page.

*2.* Build a query for each of the different types of connection request API calls into the platform your game has made:

* Here, we have four kinds of connection request in the API Stream we can query for.
* For displaying the returned data, we've selected to group by *Type*, calculate for *Count of Request*, and use a daily period for charts.


*3.* Click *Update*. The current API Stream data is queried and the data is returned:
