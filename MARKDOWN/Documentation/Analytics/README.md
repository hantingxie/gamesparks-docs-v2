# Analytics

The GameSparks platform aggregates a wide range of analytics data and provides you with key performance trends and metrics for tracking and monitoring player interaction with your game:
* Use the [Analytics Overview](/Documentation/Analytics/Working with Analytics Overview.md) to review analytics "Big Numbers", performance graphs, and *AnalyticsRequest* data. You can also export analytics data collections as JSON.
* Build custom queries against the current [API calls data stream](/Documentation/Analytics/API Stream Analytics.md) to build graphs and charts using that data.
