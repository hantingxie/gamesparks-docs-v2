# Importing Screens from Library

The Gamesparks platform offers several pre-built management Screens, which you can import from a Screen library into your game. The Screens are designed to help you perform your core game management tasks:
* Player Management
* Leaderboard Management
* Script Log Viewer

These Screens have been built with ease of use and convenience very much in mind:
* User friendly, customizable, and provide you with very useful ways of visually searching for, accessing, and editing records.
* When you import a Screen, its constituent Snippets are imported along with it as a package.
* Working with the Screens requires no code-writing skills or ability to access and work with the NoSQL database, which means your non-dev team members can easily set-up and use them.

This topic shows you how to download any of the pre-configured Screens and introduces you to the functionality each Screen offers.

* The imported Screens are added to the *Screen Builder*.
