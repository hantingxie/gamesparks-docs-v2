# User Management

This area allows the creation of game Collaborators and Groups. Collaborators are people that can log in with their user credentials and view/edit the game, depending on the security settings set for them by assigning them to a permissions Group. An in-depth tutorial can be found [here](/Tutorials/Capabilities/README.md).
