# Accessing and Updating Player Records

## Introduction

An important part of a back-end is the ability to access your player's info in real-time and have the ability to change it. GameSparks gives you the ability to do this using multiple approaches.

This tutorial explores how to access player records using the NoSQL Explorer, Player management screen, and cloud code. Â 

## Working with the NoSQL Explorer

The NoSQL Explorer is a powerful tool you can use to access and find any collection of data you have in your game:

*1.* To open the NoSQL Explorer, click *NoSQL* left side of the portal.

*2.* To access player data, select the *Find* tab and use the 'player' collection to query for specific players or run the search for every player:

*3.* When records are retrieved, you can click on them to expand them. Once expanded you can see all the data that are linked to the player including data you can't normally see when you call an account details request - data such as auth tokens, external IDs, reserved currency, and private data, which you may not see and use often. An example of a newly created player's record:

## Using the Player Management Screen

You can use the player management screen to offer a visual experience while you access player data and change variables realtime. The player management screen can be found in the manage section of the portal.

*1.* To access player data, click *Manage>Players*.

*2.* On the *Player Search* panel, build and submit a query for the player data you want. The results of the query are returned into the *Results* panel.

*3.* To view the player data for a result, click the edit ![](/img/fa/edit.png) icon. The *Edit Player* screen appears:

* You can use the dynamic forms builder to customize this screen in whatever way you like.
* You can tailor your team's experience and design what is shown on the screen to suit different users. For example, you can offer special screens for customer service, where they are allowed to change certain values, while your programmers have access to a different screen.

## Accessing Data through Cloud Code

You can use Cloud code to retrieve players and access their records. You can do this through a specified ID which you can retrieve from [AccountDetailsRequest](/API Documentation/Request API/Player/AccountDetailsRequest.md).

```

//You can have the player ID saved or manually passed in
var playerID = "5602c3dce4b07961f34b68c3" //Manually set the ID

//Finding the player through their ID
var playerVar = Spark.loadPlayer(playerData.$oid); //or (playerID) //Make a reference for that player through their ID.
```
