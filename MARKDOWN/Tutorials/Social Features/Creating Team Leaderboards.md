# How to Create a Team Leaderboard

You can create a Leaderboards that shows the performance of a *team* rather than the performance of a single player. For team-based Leaderboards, you need a few things in place. This tutorial will take you through the process of getting them set up.

In this example, we'll create a team type called *Squad*. When a player posts a score, the team they belong to will be credited with the score. This team score can then be used on a Leaderboard for the team.

## Creating a Team Type

*1.* Navigate to *Configurator > Teams*.

*2.* Click the plus ![](/img/fa/plus.png) icon. The *Create Team Type* dialog appears:

![](img/TeamLDR/5.png)

Here we've called the team type *Squad* and set the team to have a maximum of 5 members (*Max Members*).

*3.* Click *Save*.

## Creating the Event

We'll create a simple high score Event that takes a single score parameter.

*1.* Navigate to *Configurator > Events*.

*2.* Click the plus ![](/img/fa/plus.png) icon. The *Create Event* dialog appears:

![](img/TeamLDR/6.png)

In this example, the score we are passing should be added to all the previous scores submitted towards that team. So we've set the *Default Calc* to sum them up. This will create the default Running Total for the Event, allowing us to track the score for a player.

*3.* Click *Save*.

## Creating the Team Running Total

We also want to track the score for the team. We'll need to create another Running Total for the High Score Event, one that tracks the value for a *team* instead of tracking the score for a single player.

*1.* Navigate to *Configurator > Leaderboards*.

*2.* Select the *Running Totals* tab.

*3.* Click the plus ![](/img/fa/plus.png) icon. The *Create Running Total* dialog appears:


![](img/TeamLDR/7.png)

We select the *High Score* Event but the key change in this Running Total is that we have set the *Type* parameter to the team type we want this running total to track - *Squad*. We are now in a position where the GameSparks platform is going to track a Running Total for each Squad and will sum each score submitted by each team member.

*4.* Click *Save*.

## Creating the Leaderboard

*1.* Navigate to *Configurator > Leaderboards*.

*2.* On the *Leaderboards* tab, click the plus ![](/img/fa/plus.png) icon. The *Create Leaderboard* dialog appears:

![](img/TeamLDR/8.png)

We create the Leaderboard in the same way we would for personal Leaderboards, but we specify the team type that the Leaderboard is for in the *Type* parameter.

*3.* Click *Save*.

## Team Notifications

Notifications are processed slightly differently for personal Leaderboards and team Leaderboards:

|Notification   |Personal Leaderboard  |Team Leaderboard
|---|---|---|
|New High Score   |When a player posts a new high score to this Leaderboard, they will receive a [NewHighScoreMessage](/API Documentation/Message API/Leaderboards/NewHighScoreMessage.md).|When a player posts a new high score to this Leaderboard, they will receive a [NewTeamScoreMessage](/API Documentation/Message API/Leaderboards/NewTeamScoreMessage.md).   |
|Social Notifications  |When a player beats his friends, they will receive a [SocialRankChangedMessage](/API Documentation/Message API/Leaderboards/SocialRankChangedMessage.md).   |When a player posts new high score to this Leaderboard, the other team members will receive a [NewTeamScoreMessage](/API Documentation/Message API/Leaderboards/NewTeamScoreMessage.md). |
|Top N Notifications  |When a player's rank is increased due to a new score being posted (and they are in the top N of the Leaderboard) they will receive a [GlobalRankChangedmessage](/API Documentation/Message API/Leaderboards/GlobalRankChangedMessage.md).   |When a teams rank is increased due to a new score being posted (and they are in the top N of the Leaderboard) they will receive a [TeamRankChangedmessage](/API Documentation/Message API/Teams/TeamRankChangedMessage.md). |
