# Database Access and Cloud Storage

Here are some tutorials that will help you to perform common tasks involving database access and cloud storage:
* To process your queries more efficiently, you can [create indexes](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Creating Game Collection Indexes.md) for your custom data collections.
* No matter how big your data collections, you can use some handy tools for [searching for players and teams](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Searching for Players and Teams.md).
* If you have a complex JSON document stored, you can build [partial queries or updates](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Submitting JSON Document Queries.md) for specific sections of the document.
* You can allow players to [upload binary content](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Uploading Binary Content from Game.md) to host it on the GameSparks platform and share content with other players.
* There are some best practices you can follow for [persisting data](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Managing Data Persistence.md) on the GameSparks platform.
* Some important guidelines for working with runtime collections using [NoSQL Retrieval and Persistence](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Basic NoSQL Retrieval and Persistence.md) methods.
* You might want to make some [game-specific data](/Tutorials/Database Access and Cloud Storage/Creating and Using Game Specific Data.md) available to your players.
