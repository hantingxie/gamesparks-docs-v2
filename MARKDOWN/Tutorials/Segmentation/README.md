# Segmentation

Segmentation is an extremely powerful feature which allows you to create partitions for different users and apply various rules to different areas of the platform. The tutorials in this section show you how to build in this extra dimension of flexibility for precisely customizing your player experience and behavior:
* Using [Custom Segment Query Filters](/Tutorials/Segmentation/Using Custom Segment Query Filters.md) for segmenting configuration objects in your game.
* Using GameSparks [Properties](/Tutorials/Segmentation/Working with Segmented Properties.md) to deploy custom JSON configuration against objects and applying different values to Properties by Segment.
