# Hearthstone example

These tutorials provide a worked example of how to create a Hearthstone style card game on the GameSparks platform using already existing components and combining them to produce a fully functioning game on the cloud. We'll use the NoSQL database, matches, challenges, cloud code, events, modules, and the test harness to ensure the game is developed and functions the way we want it to.

We'll create a card game where each card represents a pre-defined type of card with attack, hit points, tier and effect stats. Two players are pitted against each other and use the cards to lower each other's health to 0. First player to reach 0 loses.

* First, how to set up [player initialization and the ranking system](/Tutorials/Multiplayer/Hearthstone Example/Initialization and Ranking.md).

* Second, how to configure for [matchmaking](/Tutorials/Multiplayer/Hearthstone Example/Matchmaking.md).

* And finally, how to manage [challenge](/Tutorials/Multiplayer/Hearthstone Example/Challenge.md) behavior in your game.

After following this worked example, you should be a lot more comfortable creating games on our platform and you get the chance to work on the platform and experiment with the overall framework.
