# Construct 2 Virtual Goods

This tutorial will demonstrate how to purchase Virtual Goods and view player records.

## Purchase Request and Response

Create an action that will build and send the [BuyVirtualGoodsRequest](/API Documentation/Request API/Store/BuyVirtualGoodsRequest.md). We'll be buying the *Gold_Coin* Virtual Good we created in the [previous tutorial](/Getting Started/Creating a Virtual Good/README.md). Set the quantity and currency type to 1 and set the Short Code to the name of the item. Here is an example of the request in Construct 2:

The response will help you confirm the item that's been purchased and whether or not any errors occurred. As we did in the [Leaderboard tutorial](/Getting Started/Creating a Leaderboard/Construct 2 Leaderboards.md), we have to load the response into a JSON object. Then, using the Repeat System command to check the size of the *boughtItems* array in the response, we can loop through and check exactly what was bought. In this case, we loop through the bought items to append the *Item* and *Quantity* to in-game Text:

If the player doesn't have the needed funds, the response will come back with a useful error message:
* These messages can be relayed to players to inform them that they need to earn a little more to be able to afford this item.
* For full list of errors please check our [API Documentation](/API Documentation).

## Using AccountDetailsRequest

Now weâ€™ll create an action which will retrieve your player's record. With this you can iterate through various fields to display to the game or keep them on record for any in-game logic.

*1.* Create an action that builds the [AccountDetailsRequest](/API Documentation/Request API/Player/AccountDetailsRequest.md) and sends it:

*2.* Next we load the data into JSON:

From here we can do a number of things. We can:
* Iterate through the array of Achievements returned to list them in a progress page.
* Find how much of a particular Virtual Good a player has.
