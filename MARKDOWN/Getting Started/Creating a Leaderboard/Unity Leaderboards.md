# Unity Leaderboard

## Introduction

This tutorial will go over the process of creating a Leaderboard, along with an Event which will be used to post scores to that Leaderboard. You will then see how in Unity:
* The scores can be submitted.
* You can retrieve Leaderboard data.
* You can receive High Score Messages.

You don’t need anything extra to follow this tutorial, but if you’d like to see the project you can download it:

* **Example Unity Leaderboard** code can be downloaded [here](http://repo.gamesparks.net/docs/tutorial-assets/UnityLeaderboard_Tutorial.zip)

## Creating the Score Event

The first thing you need to do is create an Event that will push the player’s score to the Leaderboard.

<q>**More Details on Events?** For an in-depth guide about Events click [here](/Documentation/Configurator/Events.md).</q>


For this tutorial, your new Event needs one Attribute, which will be the score, and you can call the Event something like *Submit Score*. You can see the options for creating an Event are as follows:

*   *Short Code* – This mandatory field is the reference by which you will call the Event. *Short Codes* are always unique.
*   *Name* – This mandatory field is used when representing the Event in Test Harness as well as in Cloud Code.
*   *Description* – This mandatory field is used to display what the Event is used for. You can use this field for your own benefit by entering a description of the Event's purpose.
* For the Attribute:
	*   *Attribute Name* - This field is the name of the Attribute you want to pass into the Event. In your case this will be *Score*.
	*   *Attribute Short Code* – This is the reference you'll be using to pass in an Attribute into the Event from Unity. In your case this will be *SCORE*.
	*   *Data Type* – The type of data being passed in - String, Number, JSON. In your case, select *Number*.
	*   *Default Value* – This would be the default value that would be used for this Event Attribute if it’s not passed into the [LogEventRequest](/API Documentation/Request API/Player/LogEventRequest.md) , that is, a score of zero would be the default.
	*   *Default Calculation* – This determines how values are tracked in the Running Totals. In your case you want the score to record the maximum, which means the Leaderboard will only record the player’s highest score. If they submit a lower score to the board, it will not be recorded.

## Creating the Leaderboard

Next you'll need to create your Leaderboard.

*1.* Navigate to *Configurator > Leaderboards*.

*2.* Click the plus ![](/img/fa/plus.png) icon to add a new Leaderboard. The *Create Leaderboard* dialog appears.

<q>**More on Leaderboards?** Most of the details you see here can be left as default for this tutorial but you can get more information about Leaderboard configuration [here](/Documentation/Configurator/Leaderboards.md).</q>

*3.* The important details for us in this example are:
* *Short Code*
* *Name*
* *Description*

*4.* Click the plus icon ![](/img/fa/plus.png) to add a *Running Total* to the Leaderboard:
* If the *Submit Score* created above is the first Event you've created in your game, this will be pre-selected for the new *Running Total*. This is because it's the only applicable Event you have in your game at the moment.

## Testing the Leaderboard

Now you're ready to send some scores to your Leaderboard. However, before you go into Unity, you should test this Leaderboard in the *Test Harness*.

After authenticating yourself as a Player, find your Event in the *LogEvent* tab, enter a score, and send the Event.

![](img/UT/13.png)

Immediately after you send the request, you will see an orange message appear in the *Inspector*. This is a *NewHighScoreMessage* and when you go back into Unity you are going to set up an Event listener to execute some code whenever a player gets this Message.

### Getting the Leaderboard Data

You can also check your Leaderboard data entries from the Test Harness using the [LeaderboardDataRequest](/API Documentation/Request API/Leaderboards/LeaderboardDataRequest.md):
* You can find this in the *Leaderboards* tab on the *Test Harness*.
* This request gives you a lot of control over the entries it will return. However, you are only concerned with the Leaderboard *Short Code* and the *entry count* (the number of entries this request will return).
* When you send the request, you'll see the list of Leaderboard entries returned on the *Inspector* on the right:

Now you're ready to start sending and receiving Leaderboard data in Unity.

### Getting the Leaderboard Data in Unity


In the previous tutorial on Cloud Code, you've already seen how to send a *logEventRequest* in Unity, which you can check out [here](/Getting Started/Using Cloud Code/Unity Cloud Code.md). The code is as follows:

```

new GameSparks.Api.Requests.LogEventRequest().SetEventKey("SUBMIT_SCORE").SetEventAttribute("SCORE", "1234").Send((response) => {
	if (!response.HasErrors) {
		Debug.Log("Score Posted Successfully...");
	} else {
		Debug.Log("Error Posting Score...");
	}
});

```

To get the Leaderboard data back, you need to call a *LeaderboardDataRequest*, the same way you did using the Test Harness:

```

new GameSparks.Api.Requests.LeaderboardDataRequest().SetLeaderboardShortCode("HIGHSCORE_LEADERBOARD").SetEntryCount(100).Send((response) => {
	if (!response.HasErrors) {
		Debug.Log("Found Leaderboard Data...");
		foreach(GameSparks.Api.Responses.LeaderboardDataResponse._LeaderboardData entry in response.Data) {
			int rank = (int) entry.Rank;
			string playerName = entry.UserName;
			string score = entry.JSONData["SCORE"].ToString();
			Debug.Log("Rank:" + rank + " Name:" + playerName + " \n Score:" + score);
		}
	} else {
		Debug.Log("Error Retrieving Leaderboard Data...");
	}
});

```

The important thing here is to get the information back out of the Leaderboard Data:
* *response.Data* contains a collection of Leaderboard data you can iterate through and get the entry details back.
* *LeaderboardData* has a lot of information you can access, and you can check out more information about it [here](/API Documentation/Request API/Leaderboards/LeaderboardDataRequest.md).

Now, running the Request will print out the details of each of the Leaderboard entries in the console:

## Message Listeners

Finally you'll want to hook up the *NewHighScoreMessage* listener so that you can have some custom code execute when the player receives a new High Score:
* In Unity, player messages have listeners you can assign delegate functions to. Then, each time the player receives a message, the method will execute and you can get details about the message from within these methods.
* It's best to apply the listener in an *Awake()* method, because the player could have messages waiting on the server for them that they might miss if the code cannot execute the moment they log on.

```

void Awake() {
	GameSparks.Api.Messages.NewHighScoreMessage.Listener += HighScoreMessageHandler;
}
void HighScoreMessageHandler(GameSparks.Api.Messages.NewHighScoreMessage _message) {
	Debug.Log("NEW HIGH SCORE \n " + _message.LeaderboardName);
}

```

Now, to test this out, enter a new High Score for your player in the Unity sample project. You should see the *NEW HIGH SCORE* message appear in the console window:
