A comparison operation on the owners (players in a player-based leaderboard, teams in a team-based leaderboard) of entries within leaderboards.
<pre rel="highlighter" code-brush="js" contenteditable="false">var operation = Spark.getLeaderboards().union(lb1, lb2);</pre>

## union
_signature_ union([SparkLeaderboard](/API Documentation/Cloud Code API/Leaderboards/SparkLeaderboard.md) rhs)</p>
_returns_ [SparkLeaderboardOperations](/API Documentation/Cloud Code API/Leaderboards/SparkLeaderboardOperations.md)</p>

<b>validity</b> All Scripts
Performs a union on the set of owners returned as result of evaluating this operation and the owners of entries within the given leaderboard.
Returns a new SparkLeaderboardOperations object to allow further operations to be chained before evaluation.
To obtain the result of the operation call evaluate() on the SparkLeaderboardOperations returned.
<b>params</b>
rhs - the the right-hand side of the operation.
<b>example</b>
<pre rel="highlighter" code-brush="js" contenteditable="false">var inAny = operation.union(rhs).evaluate();</pre>
